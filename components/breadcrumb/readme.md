### Rationale
#### To provide the user with a way-finding structure

A breadcrumb trail consists of a list of links to the parent pages of the current page in hierarchical order. It helps users find their place within a website or web application. This should be placed before a page’s main content.

- The set of links is structured using an **ordered** list to provide semantic structure.
- A `nav` element labeled `Breadcrumb` identifies the structure as a breadcrumb trail and makes it a navigation landmark so that it is easy to locate.
- To prevent screen reader announcing the visual separators between links, they are added via CSS:
  - The separators are part of the visual presentation that signifies the breadcrumb trail. This is already semantically represented by the `nav` element with its `aria-label` of Breadcrumb. Therefore using a display technique that is not used by screen readers prevents redundant and potentially distracting verbosity.
